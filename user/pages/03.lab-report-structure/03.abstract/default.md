## Purpose

The Abstract serves to "advertize" your research paper. After reading the title, most scientists read the abstract, and from there, decide if they want to read the entire paper.

## What to include:

* the question you asked and/or the rationale behind the experiment,
* a brief description of the experimental procedures you used,
* a summary of your major findings,
* the central conclusion(s).

The abstract should:

* be a single paragraph, usually no more than 250 words,
* be self contained (i.e. understandable without reading the rest of the paper),
* have no citations (because you are summarizing the current paper).

## Strategy

* Most people write this second to last, before they construct a title.
* Try to hit the high points of each section of your report (Introduction, Methods, Results and Conclusion).
* Edit this section ruthlessly. You want it to be as succinct as possible and then some.
* This can be the hardest section to write so make sure you leave yourself enough time to do it justice.

! WARNING: Some instructors do not require an abstract, while others do. Make sure you have carefully read the requirements for the particular report you are writing.
