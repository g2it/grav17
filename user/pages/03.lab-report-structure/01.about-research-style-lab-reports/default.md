In our department, most instructors will require you to write lab reports in the same style as research reports are written.

* this is the primary way that practising scientists share their research results
* writing a formal research report will improve your understanding of the study you conducted
* this helps us evaluate your scientific thinking more in depth than we can on exams
* it develops your critical thinking skills. It is impossible to write a good report until you thoroughly understand what you did, what you found and what it means.
* science writing skills are TRANSFERABLE skills. No matter where you end up professionally, good science writing will be useful (e.g. if you become a doctor, you will need to keep good patient notes).

## What is a research report?

A research report is a document that is used to share newly acquired knowledge with your scientific peers. No matter how well you conduct your research or how important your results, if you donâ€™t publish them they are useless.

## Why do research reports have such a rigid structure?

Biologists are busy people. In addition to conducting their own research, they need to stay up-to-date on the ongoing research in their field (and often other fields as well). This can mean sifting through thousands of research papers every year. Without a standard format this would be impossible to accomplish.
