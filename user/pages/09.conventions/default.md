## SI Units and Symbols

**ANY MORE SUGGESTIONS FOR WHAT TO INCLUDE HERE?**  
In research style reports, always use the appropriate symbol for SI units.

Example: ml (or mL) rather than milliliters

Here are some common SI units and associated symbols.

##### Volume    

| unit | Symbol |
|------ |------- | 
microliter | µl      
milliliter | ml      
liter      | l (or L)

##### Mass

| unit | Symbol |
|------ |------- | 
gram      | g     
milligram | mg    
microgram | µg    

##### Molarity  

| unit | Symbol |
|------ |------- | 
micromolar | µM    
millimolar | mM    
molar      | M     

##### Time  

| unit | Symbol |
|------ |------- | 
minute | min   
second | s     
hour   | h     
day    | d     

Do not add capitols or periods to the symbols unless they are at the beginning or end of a sentence respectively.

## Numbers

Always place a leading 0 in front of numbers less than 1.

0.5 NOT .5

In scientific reports we use numerals rather than words for all quantitative expressions. This emphasizes the quantitative value of what we are presenting (and also saves space).

75 base pairs  
13 plants  
0.8 mm

### Exceptions

If a sentence begins with a number you must spell it out (or better yet, reword the sentence so it does not start with a number).

If 2 numbers are adjacent, for clarification spell out one of the numbers (or better yet, reword the sentence so that 2 numbers are not adjacent). When choosing which number to spell out, keep any numbers associated with units (e.g. 5 g) as numerals.

We used five 3 g samples.  

Generally spell out one and zero (unless associated with units).

one car  
1 g  

If the numeric quantity is not the primary to the meaning of the number, spell out the number (or better yet, reword the sentence so that the number is unnecessary).
